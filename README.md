What we intend to do is to create a platform or a site where students from high school, middle school or college have free access to educational information about different kinds of opportunities they can get from this world and help them by providing different slides by different brilliant teachers from all around the world, as well as inspirational and guidance novels and videos (with subtitles) and also an audio version for all of these for people with different physical impairments. These are also followed by some features that will significantly benefit the students.
Some of the features that will be include are:
1. A very immersive home page for sharing information.
-this will contain personalized information for the different kinds of students in every grade level. Meaning, there will be content for every student. Which will be based on their sign in information.
2. Establishing a connection between student and a benefactor that will result in benefiting the student.
3. Establishing an extracurricular connection between a student and a tutor. 
4. Provide a functioning Q&A for Students with any type of queries. Which could be:
I. Providing advices and help for students that are under stress.
